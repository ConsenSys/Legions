Handy toolkit for (security) researchers poking around Ethereum nodes and contracts, now with a slick command-line interface, with auto complete commands and history.

Features:
 - Node detection (`getnodeinfo`)
   - Detect the type of the Node, Chain, and Network
   - Peer Count, Listening, Synching, and Mining status
   - Gas Price
   - etc
 - Web3 API enumeration (`investigate`)
   - Accounts
     - Read coinbase, and accounts of the address
     - (`intrusive = True`) will try to create accounts on the node
   - Admin
     - Enumerates web3.admin endpoints
   - Sign (WIP)
     - Enumerates signing functionalities (web3.sign)
 - ENS Queries ('ens)
   - List Names owned by an address
   - List Subdomains of an address
   - Query individual names
 - Query (`query`) at latest/specific block number
   - Balance of an address
   - Block details
   - Bytecode of the smart contract
   - Read storage of the smart contract (default `count=10` reads the first 10 slots)
   - command, which you can pass any RPC method with args
   - ECRecover of a signature
 - Conversions (toWei, fromWei, keccak, toChecksumAddress, etc)

## TODO:
  - [x] Able to connect to ws / http / https / IPC
  - [ ] Fix `Verbose` Status bar (It does not change from `OFF`)
  - [ ] Print Accounts in `getnodeinfo` in a pretty format (One per line)
  - [x] A way to reinitiate w3 (web3) by setting it to new host (right now it works for sethost but getnodeinfo still uses the first initiated w3)
  - [ ] add way more functionalities
  - [x] `chains.json` depending on the execution path might not be found. fix it.
  - [ ] inline TODOs (tons)
